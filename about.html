                <h5>Founding and Early Organization</h5>
                <p>
                  Chartered on August 15, 1877, as the Wyalusing District Camp Meeting Association, the Dimock Camp
                  Meeting Ground's inception was in September 1873. Congregations from the
                  <button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary py-0" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#wyalusing">Wyalusing District</button>
                  of the Wyoming Conference of the Methodist-Episcopal Church (now part of the Susquehanna Conference of
                  the United Methodist Church) held a camp meeting near Meshoppen. This spurred the idea of a permanent
                  site. Starting in October 1873, under Rev. Luther Peck's guidance, potential sites along the
                  in-progress narrow-gauge railway from Tunkhannock to Montrose were explored. The 1874 summer camp
                  meeting was again at Meshoppen due to the absence of a final decision.
                </p>
                <p>
                  By April 14, 1875, with
                  <button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary py-0" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#ira-walker">Rev. Ira Walker</button>
                  as the District's presiding elder, Dimock was selected. Walker led an 11-member committee from the
                  Wyalusing District, covering Wyoming County and parts of Bradford, Luzerne, and Susquehanna counties
                  in Pennsylvania, to establish the Dimock Camp Meeting Ground. The committee members included: Rev.
                  Jonathan K. Peck, Rev. W. L. Thorpe, Rev. J. H. Weston, Rev. S. Barner, Rev. H. G. Harned, E. L.
                  Weeks, G. E. Palen, Wilbur F. Lyman, B. W. Van Auken, and J. Beardsley.
                </p>
                <h5>Establishment of the Grounds</h5>
                <p>
                  On June 21, 1875, the committee, minus Jonathan Peck (who had to officiate a funeral), met in Dimock
                  to outline tasks. These included leasing the grounds, constructing essential buildings, sourcing
                  provisions and lumber, setting up water facilities, and organizing transportation and lighting.
                </p>
                <p>
                  July 9, 1875, marked a workbee day at Dimock on the 23.2-acre grounds leased from Col. Olney Bailey.
                  The call was for "all gentleman friends of the Camp-meeting" to assist, especially those from the
                  Wyalusing District: "Let all who cherish the vision of a beautiful grove come forth. From Bradford to Wyoming,
                  from the hills to the valleys, from towns and countryside in our splendid Susquehanna – not just to
                  prepare the Ground, but to ensure the Camp-Meeting's success."
                </p>
                <p>
                  The inaugural camp meeting-style preaching at the grounds was on August 25, 1875, attracting 7,000
                  attendees. A local newspaper noted it as the largest gathering they'd seen in Susquehanna County. By
                  1876, attendance surged to 10,000. Before this, funds were raised to buy the grounds, leading to its
                  incorporation and chartering in the Susquehanna County Courthouse. By 1877, individuals could invest
                  by buying
                  <button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary py-0" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#stock">$10 shares of stock</button>,
                  offering a say in annual meetings but no financial dividends—only spiritual ones.
                </p>
                <h5>Inaugural Meetings and Incorporation</h5>
                <p>
                  The inaugural camp meeting-style preaching on the grounds took place on August 25, 1875. Reports
                  indicated that 7,000 attendees graced the event that week. A local newspaper remarked it had never
                  "witnessed such a large gathering" in Susquehanna County "as were present on that Sunday." The
                  following year, 1876, local newspapers cited an even larger turnout of 10,000 attendees. Shortly
                  before this camp meeting, an announcement declared funds had been allocated to purchase the grounds.
                  To settle the debt, a decision was made to incorporate. A charter was subsequently lodged in the
                  Susquehanna County Courthouse. By the 1877 camp meeting, individuals had the opportunity to invest in
                  the venture by purchasing
                  <button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary py-0" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#stock">$10 shares of stock</button>.
                  While this granted them a voice at the annual board meetings, it did not offer financial dividends –
                  the true dividends were, presumably, of a spiritual nature.
                </p>
                <h5>Transformation and Modernization</h5>
                <p>
                  Attendees traveled in horse-drawn buggies or by
                  <button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary py-0" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#train">train</button>
                  opting to pitch tents or stay in boarding houses. Over time, tents transformed into about 100 cottages
                  surrounding a central square, creating an open-air amphitheater with a preacher's stand and benches.
                  It's hard to imagine accommodating 1,455 cars, 588 horses, and three motorcycles in 1918, but Dimock's
                  annual events were undoubtedly grand outdoor spectacles.
                </p>
                <p>
                  By the summer of 2011, events no longer spanned 7-to-10 consecutive days. Instead, services in the
                  <button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary py-0" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#chapel">Chapel</button>
                  (completed in 1940) were held across ten consecutive Sunday evenings. Attendees were invited to step
                  back in time for a spirit-filled experience at Dimock. Beyond these services, the grounds also hosted
                  Sunday School training, family and children's camps, and served as a retreat for pastors, lay leaders,
                  and their families.

                  In the year 2002, a significant recognition was bestowed upon the Dimock Camp Meeting Ground. The United
                  Methodist Church's General Commission on Archives and History took a noteworthy step in acknowledging
                  its historical and cultural importance. Acting upon the recommendation of the Wyoming Annual Conference,
                  the Dimock Camp Meeting Ground was designated as a national heritage landmark.

              In April 1875, the Rev. Ira Taylor Walker, then pastor of the Adams Avenue
              Methodist Episcopal Church in Scranton, was chosen as the Wyalusing District's
              Presiding Elder of the church's Wyoming Conference.  He immediately went about
              putting into place all of the things that would permanently relocate the
              Wyalusing District's camp meeting site to Dimock, a site his predecessor, the
              Rev. Luther peck, apparently had a hand in selecting.  As Presiding Elder,
              Walker oversaw the first three camp meetings at Dimock in 1875, 1876 and 1877.
              <BR>
              He wrote: "Only a few weeks ago I entered the Dimmick [sic] Grove where a Camp
              meeting will soon be held.  How forcibly I was impressed with the
              appropriateness of the place for the beginnings of a Christian life.  There,
              the beautiful shade and the streaming sun-rays which upturned the graceful
              leaves and danced forth to play with the shrubbery and grasses.  There, under
              those grand old trees, can there be found a better altar?"  (Aug. 11, 1875)

              headed up the committee looking for a permanent campground site from September
              1873 to April 1875.  The president then was the Rev. Joshua S. Lewis, for whom

              While most camp meetings showcased the best preaching from the Conference, occasionally a renowned figure
              would be invited to heighten public interest. One such figure was William Taylor. Converted at a camp
              meeting in 1841, Taylor became perhaps the Methodist Episcopal Church's most celebrated evangelist during
              the 1800s. He proclaimed a "mission field" that spanned six continents. Before his international
              endeavors, he was a street preacher in San Francisco's bowery. In 1875, he preached on four separate
              occasions at the Dimock Camp Meeting and returned in 1876. He later became a Bishop, and Taylor University
              in Upland, Indiana, is named in his honor.

            <h4>Daniel Brink Towner</h4>
            <p>
              According to a newspaper account, Prof. Daniel Brink Towner led the music at the 1876 Dimock camp meeting.
              His leadership "attracted a large audience and was one of the meeting's most captivating features. Every
              morning and evening, the voices of a large chorus could be heard singing beautiful songs of Zion, such as
              <em>Hold the Fort</em>, <em>We're going Home Tomorrow</em>, <em>What Will the Harvest Be?</em>, and <em>He
              Leadeth Me</em>."
            </p>
            <p>
              At the time, Towner was only 26, but his musical talent was so profound that he became the musical
              director of Centenary Methodist Episcopal Church in Binghamton at age 20. Throughout his life, he composed
              over 2,000 songs. In the 1880s, he began traveling with the renowned evangelist Dwight Moody. A native of
              Rome, Pennsylvania, in Bradford County, his hymn <em>Trust and Obey</em> remains a cherished piece in the
              United Methodist Hymnal.

            <h4>Cornelia Bryce Pinchot</h4>
            <p>
              The 1931 Dimock camp meeting featured Cornelia Pinchot, the First Lady of Pennsylvania. She shared her
              observations from a trip to the South Seas, where she witnessed the work of missionaries. It's likely she
              also discussed women's suffrage, birth control, educational reform, and the exploitation of child labor in
              sweatshops—all causes she passionately championed throughout her life. Pinchot encouraged women to engage
              actively in politics and careers, served on the local school board, supported prohibition, and was one of
              the first prominent women to fly in an airplane.
            </p>
            <p>
              Notably, although the Methodist Church only began allowing local ordination of women in 1924 and granted
              full clergy rights in 1956, women have been addressing the Dimock gatherings since the earliest camp
              meetings. For instance, during the inaugural 1875 meeting, Sister Sharpe spoke about her work with the
              orphaned children of former slaves in Charleston, South Carolina.

            <h4>1872</h4>
            <p>
              On July 10th, the first spike was laid for a narrow-gauge railroad to transport passengers and freight
              between Tunkhannock and Montrose. This train would eventually transport camp-meeting attendees to Dimock.
              During the first camp meeting season, trains did not operate on Sundays to respect the Sabbath.
            </p>

            <h4>1873</h4>
            <p>
              Around the time of the September camp meeting near Meshoppen, a decision was made to find a "permanent"
              site for the Wyalusing District's annual gathering. On October 22nd, a committee consisting of Luther Peck,
              J.B. Sumner, J.H. Weston, J.L. Race, P.R. Tower, and J.R. Palen took a ride on the newly completed railway
              from Tunkhannock, which extended to a point about two miles north of Dimock. They examined sites including
              Lake Carey and another just west of Springville on James Blakelee's property. Unable to finalize a
              decision by the summer of 1874, that year's District camp meeting was once again held near Meshoppen.
            </p>

            <h4>1875</h4>
            <p>
              The Rev. Ira T. Walker, who became the presiding elder of the Wyalusing District on April 14th, convened a
              meeting of the Wyalusing District Ministerial Association in Camptown on June 15th. This association
              consisted of ministers serving the 23 circuits and stations in the District. A committee of six pastors
              and five laymen was formed to oversee the establishment of a "permanent" camp meeting ground. Most of them
              met at Dimock on June 21st. On June 27th, <em>The New York Times</em> listed the Dimock grounds among
              numerous camp meetings occurring nationwide that summer. A workbee on July 9th cleared the grounds and
              began construction of necessary structures and benches. On August 25th, Rev. Walker delivered the opening
              sermon.
            </p>

            <h4>1877</h4>
            <p>
              On August 15th, the charter of the Wyalusing District Camp Meeting Association was registered in the
              Susquehanna County Court of Common Pleas. Following the charter's approval, residents from Nicholson
              constructed the first substantial cottage on the grounds.
            </p>

            <h4>1878</h4>
            <p>
              Administrative changes in the Wyoming Conference led to the dissolution of the old Wyalusing District. Its
              former preaching locations were reassigned among three of the Conference's new six districts. Dimock was
              placed in the Binghamton District, which already had its own camp meeting ground at Carmel Grove. A tornado
              destroyed the Carmel Grove auditorium one month before the summer 1914 program, ending its use as a camp
              meeting ground. In 1910, another realignment in the Wyoming Conference reduced the number of districts to
              four, placing Dimock in the Wilkes Barre District, which had a camp meeting ground at Wyoming until 1908.
              Dimock persisted.
            </p>

            <h4>1882</h4>
            <p>
              The first By-laws of the Wyalusing District Camp Meeting Association were adopted, mandating, among other
              things, that all association directors be members of the Methodist Episcopal Church.
            </p>

            <h4>1885</h4>
            <p>
              A new boarding hall (the current Dining Hall) was prepared for the August camp meeting season. A news item
              from the Montrose paper highlighted that "Vegetables, meat, milk, bread, and other essentials could be
              procured at the Hall by those staying on the grounds. A convenient lunch stand was also available." In
              1899, piping was installed to supply water from the spring to the hall.
            </p>

            <h4>1896</h4>
            <p>
              The Montrose newspaper reported that new essential buildings had been constructed at Dimock. To offset the
              costs, the Association erected a wire fence around the grounds and introduced an admission fee of 10 cents
              for the season. The Tunkhannock newspaper mentioned that such a practice had been in place at the
              Wyoming camp meeting ground for years and effectively deterred many "undesirable characters." At Dimock,
              4,500 tickets were sold in 1899.

            <h4>1901</h4>
            <p>
              The first camp meeting season of the new century sparked a glowing assessment of the events at Dimock in
              the Montrose newspaper of September 6th: "One of the secrets of success here is the singular religious aim
              of the meeting which proves that the plain gospel has not lost its power over the multitudes." However, on
              the same day, U.S. President William McKinley was shot in Buffalo, N.Y., and died on September 14th.
            </p>

            <h4>1917</h4>
            <p>
              On April 2nd, U.S. President Woodrow Wilson asked Congress to declare war on Germany, and it concurred. It
              was hoped to be a war that would end all wars. An armistice was signed on November 11, 1918. At the 1917
              camp meeting at Dimock, Rev. Richard H. Gilbert of Berwick spoke on "Germany and the Germans and Why We
              Must Fight."
            </p>

            <h4>1918</h4>
            <p>
              Perhaps because the Great War had left Americans with a new sense of their own mortality, some 10,000
              persons attended this year's Dimock camp meeting. It likely resulted in Dimock's worst-ever traffic jam as
              local newspapers cited the same official report of 1,455 cars, 588 horses, and three motorcycles on the
              grounds.
            </p>

            <h4>1925</h4>
            <p>
              The 50th anniversary of the first camp meeting held on these Dimock grounds was celebrated with a camp
              meeting week from July 30th through August 9th. The Rev. George O. Beers conducted the week's first
              service.
            </p>

            <h4>1940</h4>
            <p>
              Dimock's present chapel, where Sunday evening services are held, was built almost entirely by Wilkes Barre
              District pastors of the Wyoming Conference with assistance from a few laypersons who generously donated
              their labor. The chapel was dedicated on July 14th by Rev. George M. Bell, Wilkes Barre District
              Superintendent.
            </p>

            <h4>1941-1945</h4>
            <p>
              America was involved in World War II. Methodist Rural Life Institutes and youth camps became a fixture on
              the Dimock grounds. However, with the addition of Sky Lake by the Wyoming Conference, youth camps
              eventually ceased at Dimock. Additionally, following the war, the larger Methodist Church played an
              important role in establishing a World and National Council of Churches, and the ecumenical spirit was
              reflected on the grounds here in subsequent programming that welcomed persons of varying faith backgrounds.
            </p>

            <h4>1950</h4>
            <p>
              The 75th anniversary of the first camp meeting held on these Dimock grounds was celebrated with a series
              of Sunday meetings. July 16th was a particularly big day with the Rev. Robert Morris of Chicago, who had
              visited previously in the 1930s, preaching with some of that "old-time fervor" at 11am, 2:30pm, and 8pm.
            </p>

            <h4>1954</h4>
            <p>
              On October 15th, Hurricane Hazel swept through the area of the Dimock grounds, leading to the eventual
              demolition of one cottage.
            </p>

            <h4>1969</h4>
            <p>
              On July 20th, the U.S. achieved the milestone of putting the first man on the moon - Neil Armstrong. On
              that same day, during the third Sunday evening service of the season, Dimock also tried something
              different with its programming. Roman Catholic Father Frank Campbell, who taught at the Pope Pius Seminary
              in Dalton, delivered the message.
            </p>

            <h4>1977</h4>
            <p>
              The 100th anniversary of Dimock's original charter was celebrated with both Sunday evening services
              throughout the summer and a weeklong centennial camp meeting that featured Methodist Bishop James Ault on
              August 14th.
            </p>

            <h4>2002</h4>
            <p>
              The 125th anniversary of Dimock's original charter was celebrated with services on nine consecutive Sunday
              evenings. On July 14th, a Founders Day program paid tribute to the Rev. Paul Hulslander, and a few
              cottages were open to the public. That evening, hymnwriter P.P Bliss was commemorated by the Rev. Thomas
              Jacobs, a pastor from State College, along with the <em>All for ONE</em> gospel quartet and a parade of
              banners from supporting churches.
