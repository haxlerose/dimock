      <P>
      In the late 1700s, a tradition was begun in America in which individuals eager
      to spread their Christian faith gathered in revival-styled services for days
      on end, first camping out under the stars, later in tents, and eventually in
      wooden cottages all surrounding an open-air sanctuary.  Originally, the
      Baptists, Presbyterians and Methodists were a part of the mix, but it was the
      Methodist Episcopal Church that saw camp meetings as an integral part of
      helping people renew their faith commitments while sharing
      fellowship with like-minded individuals in their region. 
      <P>
      By 1810, Methodist Bishop Francis Asbury noted in his journal that it was his
      hope that at least 600 camp meetings could be held annually throughout the
      young United States.  In 1807, the first known camp meeting in this area
      occurred about 30 miles northwest of Dimock, near present-day Smithboro, New
      York.  It went on for four days and Asbury was in attendance during the
      last two. 
      <P>
      By the 1870s, plans were underway to install permanent camp meeting grounds in
      each of the regional districts within the Methodist Episcopal Church's annual
      conferences.  The Dimock grounds were to serve the Wyalusing District, then
      one of seven districts in the Methodist Episcopal Church's Wyoming
      Conference.  The Wyalusing District was dissolved in 1879, but camp meetings
      continued.
