The first camp meeting season of the new century sparked a glowing assessment
of the goings on at Dimock in the Montrose newspaper of September 6th: "One of
the secrets of success here is the singular religious aim of the meeting which
proves that the plain gospel has not lost its power over the multitudes."
But, at the other end of the spectrum on that day, U.S. President William
McKinley is shot at Buffalo, N.Y., and dies on September 14th.

On April 2nd, U.S. President Woodrow Wilson asks Congress to declare war on
Germany, and it concurs.  It is supposed to be a war that ends all wars.  An
armistice is signed November 11, 1918.  At the 1917 camp meeting at Dimock,
Rev. Richard H. Gilbert of Berwick spoke on "Germany and the Germans and Why
We Must Fight."

Perhaps because the Great War had left Americans with a new sense of their own
mortality, some 10,000 persons flocked to this year's Dimock camp meeting.  It
very likely created Dimock's worst-ever traffic jam as local newspapers cited
the same official report of 1,455 cars, 588 horses and three motorcycles on
the grounds.

the 50th anniversary of the first camp meeting held on these Dimock grounds is
celebrated with a camp meeting week from July 30th through August 9th.  The
Rev. George O. Beers conducts the week's first service.

Dimock's present chapel, where Sunday evening services are held, was built
almost entirely by Wilkes Barre District pastors of the Wyoming Conference
with a little help from a few laypersons who generously donated their labor.
The chapel was dedicated on July 14th by Rev. George M. Bell, Wilkes Barre
District Superintendent.

America is involved in World War II.  Methodist Rural Life Institutes and
youth camps become a fixture on the Dimock grounds.  However, with the
addition of Sky Lake by the Wyoming Conference, youth camps eventually end at
Dimock.  Also, following the war, the larger Methodist Church plays an
important role in bringing about a World and National Council of Churches and
the ecumenical flavor is reflected on the grounds here in subsequent
programming that brings in persons of varying faith backgrounds.

The 75th anniversary of the first camp meeting held on these Dimock grounds is
celebrated with a series of Sunday meetings.  July 16th is a particular big
day with the Rev. Robert Morris of Chicago, who had been here before in the
1930's, preaching with some of that "old-time fervor" at 11am, 2:30pm, and
8pm.

On October 15th, Hurricane Hazel makes a run through the area of the Dimock
grounds, forcing the eventual demolition of one cottage.

On July 20th, the U.S. puts the first man on the moon - Neil Armstrong.  On that
same day, the third Sunday evening service of the season, Dimock also tries
something a little different with its programming.  Roman Catholic Father
Frank Campbell, who teaches at the Pope Pius Seminary in Dalton, delivered the
message.

The 100th anniversary of Dimock's original charter is celebrated with both
Sunday evening services throughout the summer as well as a weeklong centennial
camp meeting that features Methodist Bishop James Ault on August 14th.

The 125th anniversary of Dimock's original charter is celebrated with services
on nine consecutive Sunday evenings.  On July 14th, a Founders Day program
pays tribute to the Rev. Paul Hulslander, and a few cottages are open to the
public  That evening the hymnwriter P.P Bliss is brought back to life by
the Rev. Thomas Jacobs, a pastor from State College, along with the <em>All
for ONE</em> gospel quartet and a parade of banners from supporting churches.
