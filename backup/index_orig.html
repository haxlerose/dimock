      The Dimock Camp Meeting traces its roots back to 1875 when a decision was made
      by several Methodist Episcopal congregations in the region to create "a
      permanent campmeeting ground" in the then Wyalusing District of the Methodist
      Church.  Its purposes were spiritual revival and evangelization as the "plain
      gospel" was proclained and taught.  The Camp Meeting was chartered in
      1877.  When the Wyalusing District was dissolved in 1878, few would have
      dreamed that it could sustain itself.  But God has worked in wondrous yet
      mysterious ways, and we are pleased to welcome you once again in 2013 to
      take part in a series of Sunday evening worship experiences in the
