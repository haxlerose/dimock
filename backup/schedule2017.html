      They love doing this, you can tell.

      in blues, country and gospel.
      Audiences across the country have agreed, with overwhelming enthusiasm,
      that they need to do it more often.
      They just have that wonderful chemistry that is so hard to define, but
      so much fun to see and hear.
      Individually, they've been honored by the Recording Industry Association of
      America (The Grammy people), the National Endowment for the Arts,
      Billboard Magazine, ASCAP, BMI, and many others.
      You don't wanna miss them live.
      They've done enough in their careers to get you there, they'll do enough
      live to get you comin' back.
