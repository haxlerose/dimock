      They return after many years with Scott Jacobs (son of Jacobs Brothers)
      bringing his prison, drug and alcohol recovery music ministry. <BR>
      Scott is the director and cofounder of C11 ministries.
      As a songwriter and music missionary, Scott has committed himself to
      composing music that is bathed in scripture but remains musically
      relative for those individuals that the ministry is reaching in prisons,
      rehabs and church pews. <BR>
      It is the prayer of this ministry and its board of directors that when
      people listen to the music of C11, they won't just be stimulated by
      catchy melodies or intricate harmonies, but they will have their hearts
      transformed by the living and powerful Word of God.
      <BR>
