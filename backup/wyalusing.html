<P>
Incidentally, the minister who served a circuit was called (unofficially)
a <em>circuit rider</em> or a <em>saddlebag preacher</em> as he moved between
the congregations in his circuit on horseback, carrying his possessions in his
saddlebags.  He would preach any day and any where - indoor or outdoor.  It
might take him more than a month to traverse his circuit!
